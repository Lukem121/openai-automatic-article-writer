Read on to find out how to best prepare for an unforgettable solo journey with all the information you need to know in order to make the most of your journey. <strong>Understand the Culture of Place You Will Visit</strong> Before departing on your solo journey, it is always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the culture of the places you will be visiting. Doing some research and learning about the customs, language and currency of the new country will give you a head start and help you to quickly become accustomed to your new destination.This will also allow you to avoid any potentially unwelcome surprises such as unfamiliar regional etiquette laws and local customs. Take some time to browse the internet and read up on what you need to know. Also reach out to your family, friends and peers on social media to see if someone else has already been to the country or has inside knowledge that they can share with you.<strong>Plan Ahead and Research Accommodation Options</strong>When travelling to a new place, having mainly pre-planned and researched accommodation options can save you a lot of stress, particularly if you are travelling alone. It is important to develop an itinerary and a plan before you embark on your journey, taking into account the places you would like to visit and staying the night, should it be necessary. Researching ahead of time will help you to find comfortable, safe, and affordable accommodation to stay in. If possible, check the reviews and ratings of the property before you book, as this will help to give you a better understanding of what to expect. There are plenty of sites online where you can book safe and affordable accommodation, or alternatively, you can speak to the locals when you arrive and find out where they recommend staying. <strong>Choose the Right Travel Insurance</strong>When travelling abroad, particularly when travelling solo, it is extremely important to make sure you have the correct travel insurance to cover your trip and emergency situations. Even if you think you may not need it, it is always best to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. Make sure you take the time to research the terms, conditions and cover of the policy before you purchase. Consider any activities that you may take part in, such as skiing, mountain hikes, and any other potentially hazardous activities. Ensure that you are adequately covered for all these of activities and that should an emergency situation arise you are covered and able to seek help.<strong>Enjoy your Journey without Stress</strong>Although it is wise to be cautious and prepared, it is also important to ensure you don’t let the feeling of stress override your journey. Make sure you plan out your trip with enough time for unexpected surprises, so you can enjoy and make the most of your journey. Rely on your instinct and make sure you don’t place yourself in any unnecessary situations that could be dangerous. If something doesn’t seem right, trust your gut and stay clear. <strong>Take the Necessary Steps to Stay Safe</strong>When travelling alone, there are some very important steps that you need to take in order to stay safe. Invest in a good set of padlocks for your luggage, and make sure that you keep all important documents, money, and valuables on your person at all times. Leave copies of your passport, flight and transport information, as well as your itinerary, with trusted family and friends before you set off on your journey. This will help them to easily contact you if there is an emergency. In addition to this, carry a ‘dummy wallet’ with you at all times, filled with obsolete cards and cash that is not of any value to you. Make sure that if you are ever mugged or assaulted, you give your attackers the dummy wallet, so that you do not lose valuable assets and important documents. <strong>Pack Smart & Light</strong> An important part of any journey is packing; but when travelling alone it is best to keep your bags light and only bring the items you consider necessary. Try to pack items that are multi-purpose and practical so that you don’t need to bring many items. Consider the climate of the destination and make sure you pack weather appropriate clothing. Try to take items that don’t take up much room, either flat items or layers of clothing that can easily be washed in the sink and dried overnight.<strong>Be Wise when Interacting with Others</strong>Whenever we travel, there is an opportunity to meet new people and explore different cultures. Enjoy the opportunity to meet new faces and learn about new cultures but remember to be wary when doing so. Do not give out personal details to strangers, and take care in bars, clubs and pubs when talking with others. In the event that you need to give out details for a hotel, for example, make sure you do not go into too much detail or show your address or passport to anyone. Also make sure that any conversations, or meeting you have with strangers remain in public spaces so that in the case of any trouble, you are not isolated. <strong>Build in Some ‘Me’ Time</strong>Taking a solo holiday can be a great opportunity to take some ‘me’ time and reflect on the journey. If you want to get the most out of your journey, it is important to factor in some downtime and build some relaxation time into your itinerary. Take some time off from sight-seeing, so that you can rest and relax in order to better enjoy the experiences that follow. <strong>Be Prepared for Any Potential Emergencies</strong>No-one likes to think about emergency situations, however it is important to be prepared for any potential problems. Find out where the local hospitals and embassies are and make sure that you have the full contact details with you - along with the necessary contact information for family and friends.Keep a list of the essential numbers and details on your person at all times, in case of any major problems. This way, should something happen and you require emergency assistance they will be readily accessible. <strong>Make the Most Out of Every Day</strong>When travelling solo, it can be easy to forget to make the most out of each day. If possible, look out for any local events such as festivals and fairs and take the time to attend them. These events are a great opportunity to immerse yourself in the local culture and appreciate the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Take the time to learn about the history and culture from the locals and ask them for their travel tips and advice. Even better, plan ahead and book some group tours so that you can explore with fellow travellers.<strong>Enjoy the Solo Journey</strong>Travelling alone can be a unique and rewarding experience, however, it is important to take the necessary precautions beforehand to make sure that you have an enjoyable journey. Once you have all of your preparation in order, you are free to explore, discover and take in as much as you can. Making lots of memories, learning new cultures, and meeting all sorts of fascinating people along the way is an adventure of a lifetime.
